LaRa Global Machine Instruction

For All AI Agents and Code Generation Tools

This project is LaRa – Low-Cost Adaptive Robotic-AI Therapy System for Down Syndrome Children.

All generated code must assume:
	•	The end users are neurodiverse children (specifically Down syndrome).
	•	The system operates in educational / therapeutic environments.
	•	Emotional safety, clarity, and predictability are higher priority than speed or novelty.

⸻

1. Core Behavioral Constraint

The system must prioritize:
	•	Predictability over randomness
	•	Clarity over complexity
	•	Stability over rapid responsiveness
	•	Gentle pacing over aggressive interaction
	•	Low cognitive load over feature richness

No code should introduce chaotic or unpredictable behavior.

⸻

2. Interaction Constraints

When generating interaction-related logic:
	•	Avoid rapid state switching.
	•	Avoid high-frequency UI or animation changes.
	•	Use slower timing defaults.
	•	Prefer simple, repetitive reinforcement patterns.
	•	Ensure graceful fallback when uncertainty is high.

If confidence in detection is low → default to neutral supportive behavior.

Never escalate interaction intensity automatically.

⸻

3. Emotion Handling Constraints

Emotion detection outputs are noisy and must be:
	•	Temporally smoothed
	•	Threshold-gated
	•	Confidence-validated

Never make decisions based on single-frame emotional inference.

Always include:
	•	Confidence threshold checks
	•	Minimum duration checks
	•	Safe fallback state

⸻

4. Safety and Ethical Constraints

The system must:
	•	Stop interaction if no face is detected.
	•	Avoid making psychological or medical claims.
	•	Avoid diagnosing.
	•	Avoid emotionally intense language.
	•	Avoid negative reinforcement patterns.

All responses must be:
	•	Encouraging
	•	Calm
	•	Structured
	•	Non-judgmental

⸻

5. Cognitive Accessibility Constraints

Generated code should ensure:
	•	Minimal on-screen clutter.
	•	Large, clear UI elements.
	•	Limited simultaneous stimuli.
	•	Clear audio with moderate pacing.
	•	Avoid flashing, fast transitions, or complex animations.

Prefer consistency over novelty.

⸻

6. Decision-Making Constraints

The LLM or AI modules must NOT:
	•	Override deterministic decision logic.
	•	Invent new behavioral states.
	•	Escalate tasks without explicit permission.
	•	Continue interaction when engagement drops critically.

All behavioral decisions must be traceable and explainable.

⸻

7. Performance Constraints

Optimize for:
	•	Stable frame processing rather than maximum FPS.
	•	Consistent latency rather than aggressive throughput.
	•	Lightweight deployment suitable for low-cost hardware.

Avoid unnecessary model complexity.

⸻

8. Logging and Transparency

All generated modules must:
	•	Log key state transitions.
	•	Log emotion confidence values.
	•	Log selected response categories.
	•	Enable offline review by caregivers.

⸻

9. Tone and Language Generation Rules

If generating speech or prompts:
	•	Use short sentences.
	•	Use simple vocabulary.
	•	Avoid sarcasm or abstract metaphors.
	•	Avoid ambiguous instructions.
	•	Provide one instruction at a time.

⸻

10. Fail-Safe Philosophy

When uncertain:
	•	Slow down.
	•	Simplify.
	•	Encourage gently.
	•	Never intensify.
