# LaRa Adaptive Learning Design

## Core Principle

Adapt conservatively. Build resilience through scaffolded challenge.

LaRa does not remove difficulty automatically. It adjusts gradually
using performance and mood stability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Inputs to Adaptation Engine

1.  Mastery Level (0--5)
2.  Real-time Mood
3.  Mood Confidence
4.  Consecutive Stability Turns
5.  Consecutive Frustration Turns

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Adjustment Rules

Difficulty may change only if: - Mood confidence \>= 0.6 - Same mood
persists for 2 turns

Increase Difficulty: - 3 stable turns - Successful task completion -
Only +1 level - Lock difficulty for 2 turns

Decrease Difficulty: - Frustration persists 2 turns - Only -1 level -
Never reduce to zero - Maintain micro-challenge

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Cooldown Rule

After any difficulty change: - Lock for 2 turns - Prevent oscillation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Educational Philosophy

LaRa builds: - Emotional tolerance - Skill mastery - Regulated exposure

It does not reward avoidance. It does not push through distress blindly.

Adaptation is proportional, predictable, and reversible.
